  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Utilised Cloudflare workers and Cloudflare's caching api to cache typically uncacheable POST HTTP api responses and serve them to calling clients from the edge directly. Delivered immediate and tangible benefits to the organisation in terms of response times, user experience and outright scalability. Also resulted in significant savings in bandwidth utilisation at the origin

    Cloudflare workers as a custom filter for unknown user login attempts
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Deployed a Cloudflare worker to check user logins against a maintained list of known users (stored in a CF KV namespace). Any unknown user login attempts are rejected immediately from the edge. Helps to protect against brute force & DDOS login attacks
